AP-Hotspot
==========

- Automatically creates an infrastructure (Access Point mode) wireless hotspot in Ubuntu that should work with Android and Windows Phone devices

- This has tested to work on **Elementary OS Luna**, but you need to install the following to make it run:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq
```
